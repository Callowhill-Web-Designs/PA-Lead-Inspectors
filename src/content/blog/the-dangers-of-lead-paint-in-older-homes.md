If you own or rent an older home, you may be living amongst a hidden hazard: lead paint. While lead-based paint was banned in the U.S. in 1978, many homes built before then still contain high amounts of it. Understanding the risks of lead exposure and how to address them is crucial for protecting the health of your family. Lead is a toxic metal that can cause serious health problems, especially for young children and pregnant women. Exposure to lead can occur when paint chips, peels, or deteriorates into dust. Children are most at risk because they may ingest lead dust through hand-to-mouth activity. Exposure to lead can lead to developmental delays, learning difficulties, behavioral issues, and damage to the brain and nervous system. For adults, lead exposure can cause high blood pressure, kidney damage, and reproductive issues.

If your home was built before 1978, it is very likely to contain lead paint. Signs to look for can include peeling, cracking, or chipping paint, dust near windows, doors, or stairways, and painted surfaces that are subject to wear, like doors and railings. Lead hazards can also arise during renovation or remodeling projects when old paint is disturbed. Even a small amount of lead dust can pose serious health risks, which is why hiring certified professionals for repairs is essential. Regular cleaning, maintenance, and awareness can help minimize exposure.

A lead inspection can identify hazards before they become dangerous. Our certified lead inspectors use specialized equipment to test surfaces for lead. If lead is detected, they can provide recommendations for managing or removing it safely. In some cases, encapsulating lead paint with a special sealant can prevent exposure without the need for complete removal. Don’t wait for signs of damage—proactively testing for lead ensures your home remains safe for your family. Contact PA Lead Inspectors to schedule a lead inspection and take the first step toward a lead-safe home. Taking action now can save you time, money, and potential health complications in the future.
