If you’re a landlord in Philadelphia or Norristown, complying with lead inspection laws isn’t just a legal requirement—it’s an essential step to protecting your tenants and your business. Philadelphia and Norristown require rental properties to pass lead inspections every four years as part of the rental license renewal process. These inspections ensure that properties are lead-safe, minimizing health risks for tenants and fostering trust between landlords and renters.

To comply, the first step is to schedule a lead inspection. Inspections typically include testing for lead in paint and dust throughout the dwelling. Ensure your property is prepared by cleaning surfaces thoroughly and making all areas accessible. Once your property passes inspection, you’ll receive a Lead-Safe Certification, which is required to renew or obtain your rental license. Results for inspection testing typically take between 2-5 business days. Next, provide the certification to the appropriate local agency to complete your compliance requirements.

Staying compliant involves more than just passing the initial inspection. Landlords should also prioritize ongoing maintenance to prevent lead hazards from reappearing. This includes addressing peeling paint promptly, maintaining clean living spaces, and educating tenants about lead safety practices. Failure to comply with lead inspection laws can result in fines, loss of your rental license, or legal action. Non-compliance could also harm your reputation as a landlord.

By staying proactive, you not only meet legal requirements but also demonstrate your commitment to tenant safety and well-being. Schedule your inspection today to ensure your property meets the necessary standards and remains a safe place for your tenants to live. Taking these steps can help safeguard your investment while contributing to healthier communities.
