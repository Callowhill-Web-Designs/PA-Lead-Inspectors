Lead safety is a shared responsibility between renters and landlords, especially in properties built before 1978, when lead-based paint was commonly used. Landlords have a legal obligation to disclose known lead hazards and to maintain a lead-safe environment. This includes performing necessary inspections and taking appropriate remediation steps if lead hazards are identified.

For renters, understanding your rights is crucial. If you suspect the presence of lead hazards in your rental property, you have the right to request a lead inspection. Open communication with your landlord is key; discussing your concerns can lead to prompt action that protects everyone’s health. Knowing your rights can empower you to advocate for a safe living space.

Both parties benefit from taking proactive measures to eliminate lead risks. Landlords can enhance their property’s value and appeal by ensuring it is lead-safe, while renters can enjoy peace of mind knowing they live in a healthy environment. Regular inspections and adherence to lead-safe work practices are essential components of this process.

Moreover, fostering a culture of lead safety can create a healthier community overall. When both landlords and renters prioritize lead safety, it reduces the risk of lead exposure for families and children who may be especially vulnerable.

Lead safety is not just a homeowner’s issue but a collective responsibility. Whether you own or rent, make it a priority to understand lead risks and take the necessary steps to mitigate them. Together, we can create safer living environments and protect the health of current and future generations. Don’t hesitate—take action today!
